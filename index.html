<body><h2 align=center>Linux IPv6 Router Advertisement Daemon (radvd)</h2>

<p>The router advertisement daemon (radvd) is run by Linux or BSD
systems acting as IPv6 routers.  It sends Router Advertisement messages,
specified by <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2461.html">RFC
2461</a>, to a local Ethernet LAN periodically and when requested by a
node sending a Router Solicitation message.  These messages are required
for IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration.</p>

<p>This release includes support for Mobile IPv6, 6to4 addressing, router
preferences and more specific routes, and
non-broadcast multiple-access links such as ISATAP.  Both Linux and BSD
are supported.  For more information about recent modifications, please
see the <a href="CHANGES">CHANGES file</a> included with the
latest release of radvd.</p>

<h3>Latest Update(s)</h3>

<p>March 5, 2010 - Version 1.6 updates:
<ul>
	<li>Decrease MSG_SIZE from 4096 to about 1500B. Send buffer
	                uses a smaller size in order to avoid sending out
	                                fragmented packets, yet being able to receive full-size
                frames.
	<li>Keep track of buffer size and exit if the number of
	                prefixes/routes/etc. would grow too much. Prevent a
memory
                corruption due to wrong memset. Patches from Jan
                                Gorig, Red Hat bug #554125.
	<li>On BSD use getifaddrs() also in setup_deviceinfo(),
	                fixes a multiple interfaces problem on NetBSD 5 due
to
                change in data structures. Patch from Michael Stapelberg.
        <li>Allow radvd.conf prefix, clients, route, and RDNSS options
                        to be in any order.  Patch from Michael Stapelberg.

<h3>Older update information</h3>

<p>September 10, 2009 - Version 1.5 updates:
<ul>
	<li>Fix infinite loop/segmentation fault problems when cable
		plugged out/plugged back in, caused by reload_config()
				and subsequent timer list corruption. 
	<li>Fix IgnoreIfMissing when cable is unplugged at startup.
		Radvd would keep skipping the interface.
	<li>Fix parallel make.				
</ul>

<p>August 3, 2009 - Version 1.4 updates:
<ul>
	<li>Fix an unintentional change in 1.3: RAs were accidentally often
	unicast to solicitors instead of being multicast.  This is still
	compliant with the specification but is not optimal.
</ul>

<p>July 7, 2009 - Version 1.3 updates:
<ul>
	<li>Add a "clients" directive which can be used to specify the clients
to which radvd will unicast RAs and ignore RSs from every other client. 
Possibly useful in gradual rollouts.
	<li>Work around Linux IPV6_RECVPKTINFO|IPV6_RECVHOPLIMIT renumbering
issues with some combinations of glibc and kernel (e.g. OpenWrt and Freetz
projects)
	<li>Use getifaddrs() on BSD instead of ioctl; work around unaligned
traps on Alpha; Make NetBSD 5 compile.
</ul>
<p>October 28, 2008 - Version 1.2 updates:
<ul>
	<li>Accept virtually any kind of interface naming convention.
	<li>If stale radvd.pid exists, try to overwrite it unless the specified PID exists.
	<li>Define _GNU_SOURCE to fix compilation with glibc >= 2.8.
	<li>Remove -Wconversion from default CFLAGS due to bogus warnings, fix some real warnings.
	<li>Decrease the default preferred lifetimes from 30/1 days to 1d/4h.
</ul>

<p>February 4, 2008 - Version 1.1 updates:
<ul>
	<li>Implement privilege separation on Linux: a master root process
            (which is able to reconfigure interfaces) and the main process.
            There is '-s' toggle to keep old behaviour.
	<li>Fix Linux retrans_timer on old kernels (newer ones have retrans_timer_ms)
	<li>Fix stderr+syslog (default) logging on non-i386 platforms.
	<li>Require that interface must be RUNNING instead of just UP. 
            <b>Note: this could break deployments with very old kernels.</b>
	<li>Implement automatic interface address advertising with special prefix ::/64.
	<li>Relax interface naming (e.g. with VLANs) requirements.
	<li>Fix ordering of route, prefix and RDNSS options (only matters with RDNSS)
</ul>

<p>November 1, 2006 - Version 1.0 updates:
<ul>
	<li>Fix AdvDefaultLifetime initalization, broken in 0.9.1.
	<li>Fix STDERR+syslog logging, don't try STDERR after forking.
	<li>Implement RDNSS draft with (non-allocated) ND type code 25.
	<li>Redefined IgnoreIfMissing: failed interfaces are now
reinitialized by default.  IgnoreIfMissing only omits warnings about these.
	<li>Unblock SIGALRM at startup.
	<li>Implement MAX_INITIAL_RTR_ADVERT_INTERVAL handling.
	<li>Perform some dynamic/static code audit, fix some minor bugs and
do cleanup as a result.
</ul>

<p>January 13, 2006 - Version 0.9.1 updates:
<ul>
  <li>Clean up signed/unsigned values, add more warnings to CFLAGS
  <li>Fix a couple of  IPv6 Ready Logo Phase-2 IPv6 Core
                  Protocols Self Test issues
  <li>Create a short FAQ in README file, other minor documentation updates
  <li>Get interface MTU automatically, so that you can
                  use jumboframes and advertise MTU >1500
</ul>

<p>October 19, 2005 - Version 0.9 updates:
<ul>
  <li>radvdump cleaned up, only config-file syntax supported
   <li>add NEMO Basic support (RFC3961) and fix default
        HomeAgentLifetime
  <li>more robust timer handler in case the kernel is buggy
  <li>new default logging method "stderr_syslog";
                Everything is logged on syslog, but the most important messages
    (i.e., start-up failures) are also logged on stderr.
</ul>

<p>July 8, 2005 - Version 0.8 updates:
<ul>
	<li>More specific route codepoint has been changed to the official value, 24.
	<li>Fix incorrect calculation of the 6to4 prefix on big-endian
architectures.
	<li>Fix a multicast join issue with HUP signal on newer 2.6.12+
Linux kernels.

	<li>Improve slightly the error messages from config file parsing.
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>A large number of fixes and cleanups
    <li>Support Router Preferences and More Specific routes
    <li>Add "IgnoreIfMissing" interface flag, to be used with
interfaces which may become available only later on 
</ul>

                 <li>fix a syntax error in radvd.conf(5) sample documentation
                 <li>use IPV6_RECV{HOPLIMIT,PKTINFO} not 
                       IPV6_{HOPLIMIT,PKTINFO} if supported
                 <li>(in Red Hat spec file) don't create radvd gid explicitly
                 <li>a lot of coding style cleanups
</ul>
